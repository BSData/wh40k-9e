            - Create an issue comment that starts with `/release` on the first line.
            - Second (non-empty) line will be used as a release title/name.
            - All following lines will be interpreted as a release description/body.
            - Description (even if empty) will always be appended with a comparison link to the previous release, unless there is no previous release.
