description: >-
  If every unit from your army (excluding UNALIGNED units) has the DEATHWATCH keyword, then every unit that has the Combat Doctrines ability and is in a DEATHWATCH Detachment gains the Mission Tactics ability below:


  Do not use the rules in Codex: Space Marines to determine which combat doctrine is active for your army during each battle round. Instead, at the start of each battle round, select the Devastator Doctrine, Tactical Doctrine or Assault Doctrine. The combat doctrine you select is active for your army until the end of that battle round. Note, however, that when selecting a combat doctrine at the start of the battle round.

  - You cannot select the Devastator Doctrine to be active for your army more than once during the battle.

  - You cannot select the Tactical Doctrine to be active for your army more than twice during the battle.

  - You cannot select the Assault Doctrine to be active for your army more than three times during the battle.
