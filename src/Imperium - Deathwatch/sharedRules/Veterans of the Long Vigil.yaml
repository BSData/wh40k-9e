  - At the start of each battle round you can select one Chapter Tactic or Successor Tactic from Codex: Space Marines. If you do, then until the start of the next battle round, this unit has that Chapter Tactic or Successor Tactic instead of Xenos Hunters.

  - You cannot select the same Chapter Tactic or Successor Tactic more than once per battle (exclude those selected for the Brotherhood of Vetererans Stratagems).

  - Each time you use the Brotherhood of Veterans Stratagem whilst STRIKE FORCE KILL TEAM and STRIKE FORCE CHARACTER units in your army are using a different Chapter Tactic to Xenos Hunters, the Chapter Tactic or Successor Tactic selected for the Stratagem replaces whatever Chapter Tactic or Successor Tactic was selected at the start of the current battle round instead.
