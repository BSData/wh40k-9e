description: >-
  If every unit from your army has the ADEPTUS ASTARTES keyword (excluding AGENT OF THE IMPERIUM and ALIGNED units), this unit gains a bonus (see below) depending on which combat doctrine is active for your army, as follows:


  • During the first battle round, the Devastator Doctrine is active for your army.

  • During the second battle round, the Tactical Doctrine is active for your army.

  • At the start of the third battle round, select either the Tactical Doctrine or Assault Doctrine: until the end of that battle round, the doctrine you selected is active for your army.

  • During the fourth and subsequent battle rounds, the Assault Doctrine is active for your army.


  Unless specified otherwise, this bonus is not cumulative with any other rules that improve the Armour Penetration characteristic of a weapon (e.g. the Storm of Fire Warlord Trait).


  Devastator Doctrine
