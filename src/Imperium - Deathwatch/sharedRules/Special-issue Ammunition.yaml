description: >-
  Each time a unit is selected to shoot, if it contains any models that are equipped with a weapon with this ability, then before you select any targets, each weapon with this ability can fire special-issue ammunition. If any do, select one of the ammunition types below for that weapon; until the end of the phase, each time that weapon is fired, apply the modifiers and abilities associated with that special-issue ammunition:


  Dragonfire Bolts:

  Each time an attack is made with a weapon firing this special-issue ammunition, the target does not receive the benefits of cover against that attack.


  Hellfire Rounds:

  Each time an attack is made with a weapon firing this special-issue ammunition against a unit that does not have the VEHICLE or TITANIC keyword, add 1 to that attack’s wound roll.


  Vengeance Rounds:

  Each time an attack is made with a weapon firing this special-issue ammunition, add 1 to the Damage characteristic of that attack.


  Kraken Bolts:

  Each time an attack is made with a weapon firing this special-issue ammunition, add 6" to the Range characteristic and improve the Armour Penetration characteristic of that attack by 1 (this is cumulative with the Armour Penetration bonus conferred by the Combat Doctrines ability – see Codex: Space Marines).
