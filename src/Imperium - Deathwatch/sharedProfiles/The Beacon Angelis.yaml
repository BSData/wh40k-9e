    value: Once per battle, if the bearer did not arrive as Reinforcements this turn, it can active the Beacon Angelis. If it does, in the Reinforcements step of your Movement phase, you can select one friendly DEATHWATCH INFANTRY or DEATHWATCH BIKER unit that is either on the battlefield and did not arrive as Reinforcements this turn, is in a teleportarium chamber or is in Strategic Reserves. Removes that unit and set it up as Reinforcements wholly within 6" of the bearer and more than 9" away from any enemy models.
