    value: Once per battle, at the start of your Movement phase, if this unit contains a TERMINATOR model, you can remove this unit from the battlefield and then, in the Reinforcements step of your next Movement phase, you can set this unit back up on the battlefield, anywhere wholly within your own deployment zone and more than 9" away from any enemy models, or anywhere within 3" of a friendly DEATHWATCH model and more than 9" away from any enemy models. If the battle ends and this unit is not on the battlefield, it is destroyed. If this unit has split into two units because of its Combat Squads ability, only one of those units can use the Deathwatch Teleport Homer ability.
