    value: If you are playing a mission that requires you to select either secondary objectives or Agendas, then after both players have revealed their selections you can select one of your secondary objectives or Agendas and replace it with a different one (make a note on your army roster as to your new selection and inform your opponent). All the normal rules for selecting secondary objectives and Agendas apply with the exemption that after using this ability, you can have two DEATHWATCH secondary objectives or DEATHWATCH Agendas. If both players have a rule that allows them to select new secondary objectives or Agendas, both players make their new selections before revealing them simultaneously to their opponent.
