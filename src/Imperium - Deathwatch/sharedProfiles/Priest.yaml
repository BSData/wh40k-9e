    value: 'This model knows the Litany of Hate and one other litany from the Litanies of Battle (see Codex: Space Marines). In your Command phase, if this model is on the battlefield, it can recite one litany it knows that has not already been recited by a friendly model this turn. Roll one D6: on a 3+ the recited litany is inspiring and takes effect until the start of your next Command phase.'
