    value: The first time this WARLORD is destroyed, you can choose to roll one D6 at the end of the phase instead of using any rules that are triggered when a model is destroyed (e.g. the Only in Death Does Duty End Stratagem). If you do, then on a 4+, set this WARLORD back up on the battlefield as close as possible to where they were destroyed and more than 1" away from any enemy models, with D3 wounds remaining.
