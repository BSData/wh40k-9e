      - At the end of your Movement phase, unless this WARLORD is a TECHMARINE, it can repar one friendly IRON HANDS VEHICLE model within 1" of it. That VEHICLE model regains 1 lost wound. Each model can only be repaired once per turn.

      - If this WARLORD is a TECHMARINE, then each time it uses its Blessing of the Omnissiah ability, the model it is repairing regains up to D3 +1 lost wounds instead of D3.
