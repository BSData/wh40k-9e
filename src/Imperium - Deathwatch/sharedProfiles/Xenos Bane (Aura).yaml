    value: While a friendly STRIKE FORCE KILL TEAM or STRIKE FORCE CHARACTER unit is within 6" of this WARLORD, that unit has the Xenos Hunters Chapter Tactic (this means that if you selected a Chapter Tactic or Successor Tactic at the start of the battle round due to the Veterans of the Long Vigil ability, that unit has both that Chapter Tactic or Successor Tactic and the Xenos Hunters Chapter Tactic).
