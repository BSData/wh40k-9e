    value: During deployment, you must set up this unit high in the skies instead of setting it up on the battlefield, but neither it, nor any units embarked upon it, are counted towards any limits that the mission you are playing places on the maximum number of Reinforcement points you can have in your army. In the Reinforcements step of any of your first, second or third Movement phase, regardless of any mission rules, you can set up this unit anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9" away from any enemy models. Any units embarked within this transport can immediately disembark after it has been set up on the battlefield for the first time, and if they do so, they must be set up more than 9" away from any enemy models.
