      Infantry units with this ability can embark within any Imperium Transport model, even if that model normally only permits models with other Faction keywords to do so. All other restrictions apply normally (e.g. Terminator models can only embark within Transports that allow Terminator models to do so).


      If your army is Battle-forged, no more than one Inquisitor unit can be included in each Inquisiton Detachment (i.e. a Detachment that includes only Inquisition units).
