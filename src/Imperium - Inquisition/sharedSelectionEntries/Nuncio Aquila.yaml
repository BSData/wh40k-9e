        value: 'In your Morale phase, you can select one enemy Infantry, Cavalry or Biker unit that is not sanctioned and is within 9" of and visible to the bearer. If you do so, roll 2D6: if the result is greater than or equal to that unit’s Leadership characteristic, then until the start of your next Morale phase that unit is sanctioned. While a unit is sanctioned, each time a model in that unit makes an attack, subtract 1 from that attack’s hit roll.'
