The first characteristic is used when a melee attack is allocated to that model, while the second characteristic is used when a ranged attack is allocated to that model. In either case, the saving throw cannot be modified in any way.'

      During deployment, you can set up this model in the warp instead of setting it up on the battlefield. If you do so, then in the Reinforcements step of one of your Movement phases you can set this unit up anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9" away from any enemy models, or more than 6" away from any enemy models and wholly within 6" of a friendly WARP LOCUS model that was on the battlefield at the start of the turn. If the WARP LOCUS has an Allegiance keyword, the unit being set up can only use this ability if it has the same Allegiance keyword.


      If every unit from your army has the LEGIONES DAEMONICA keyword, then in the Reinforcements step of one of your Movement phases, you can instead set this unit up anywhere on the battlefield with one of the following restrictions:

      - Wholly within your deployment zone and more than 3" away from any enemy models.

      - Neither wholly within your deployment zone nor within your opponent's deployment zone, and more than a number of inches away from away from each enemy unit, equal to the current Leadership characteristic of that enemy unit (to a minimum of 3" and a maximum of 9").
