description: >-
  Many Chaos Daemons weapons are malefic weapons. Such a weapon will have an ability that reads "Malefic" and then a value. Each time the bearer fights, it makes a number of additional attacks with that weapon equal to that value, and no more than that number of attacks can be made with that weapon while resolving that fight. If a model is equipped with more than one malefic weapon, it can make additional attacks with each one it is equipped with.


  Unless otherwise specified, malefic weapons are never affected by effects or abilities that allow models to make additional attacks, or abilities that would add to, subtract from or improve their characteristics in any way.
