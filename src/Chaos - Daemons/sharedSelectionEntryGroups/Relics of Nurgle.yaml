            value: Each time the bearer is selected to fight, after its attacks have been resolved, you can select one friendly PLAGUEBEARERS INFANTRY CORE unit wholly within 18" of the bearer to be replenished. Roll one D6 for each enemy model that was destroyed by the bearer this phase. For each 4+, you can return 1 destroyed model to that PLAGUEBEARERS unit with its full wounds remaining, to a maximum of 3 models per turn. These models cannot be set up within Engagement Range of any enemy units unless those enemy units are already within Engagement Range of its unit. Each unit can only be replenished once per turn.
