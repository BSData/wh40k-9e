        value: Gotfret de Montbard can attempt to deny one psychic power in each enemy Psychic phase in the same manner as a PSYKER.

rules:
  - description: >-
      If your army includes any models with this ability, you will start the battle with 3 Faith Points, plus 1 additional Faith Point for every 10 models with this ability in your army (rounding down). These can be spent to attempt the Acts of Faith listed below. Each can only be attempted once per battle round, and you must spend one Faith Point each time you do so (if you have no Faith Points remaining, you cannot attempt an Act of Faith). To attempt an Act of Faith, select a unit in your army that has the Acts of Faith ability and then choose the Act of Faith you wish to attempt. Then make a Test of Faith for the unit by rolling a D6; if the result is less than that Act of Faith’s devotion value, or is an unmodified roll of 1, the test fails and nothing happens. Otherwise the test is successful and the Act of Faith takes effect.


      Hand of the Emperor

      Devotion value 4

      Use this Act of Faith at the start of your Movement phase. If successful, add 3" to the selected unit’s Move characteristic until the end of that phase.


      Spirit of the Martyr

      Devotion value 3

      Use this Act of Faith at the start of your Movement phase. If successful, one model in the selected unit regains D3 lost wounds, or, if there are no wounded models and any models in the unit have been slain, you can return one slain model to the unit with 1 wound remaining (this model is set up in unit coherency and cannot be set up within 1" of any enemy models – if it is not possible to place this model, it is not returned to the unit).


      Aegis of the Emperor

      Devotion value 3

      Use this Act of Faith at the start of your opponent’s Psychic phase. If successful, then until the end of that phase, roll a D6 each time the selected unit suffers a mortal wound. On a 4+ that mortal wound is ignored.


      Divine Guidance

      Devotion value 4

      Use this Act of Faith at the start of your Shooting phase. If successful, add 1 to hit rolls for attacks made with this unit’s ranged weapons until the end of the phase.


      The Passion

      Devotion value 5

      Use this Act of Faith at the start of your Fight phase. If successful, the selected unit can be chosen to Fight with twice in that phase, instead of only once.


      Light of the Emperor

      Devotion value 3

      Use this Act of Faith at the start of the Morale phase. If successful, the selected unit automatically passes Morale tests that phase.
