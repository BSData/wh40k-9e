  Vow:

  - Each time a model in this unit makes a melee attack against a non-VEHICLE unit, an unmodified hit roll of 6 automatically wounds the target.


  Passion:

  - Each time this unit is selected to charge, the closest enemy non-AIRCRAFT unit that is within 12" and not within Engagement Range of any other BLACK TEMPLARS units from your army must be declared as a target of that charge.
