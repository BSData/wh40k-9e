  Vow:

  - Models in this unit have a 5+ invulnerable save.

  - Each time an attack is made against this unit, an unmodified wound roll of 1-2 for that attack fails, irrespective of any abilities that the weapon or the model making the attack may have.


  Passion:

  - Each time an enemy model makes an attack against this unit, this unit does not receive the benefits of cover against that attack.
