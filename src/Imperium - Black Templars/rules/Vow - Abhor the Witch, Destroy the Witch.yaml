  Vow:

  - Once per battle, in your first Movement phase, if there are any enemy PSYKER units in your opponentâ€™s army, until the end of the phase, add 3" to the Move characteristic of models in this unit.

  - Each time a model in this unit makes a melee attack against a PSYKER unit, re-roll a wound roll of 1.


  Passion:

  - While an enemy PSYKER unit is within 18" of this unit, this unit cannot perform any actions.
