  Vow:

  - While this unit is within Engagement Range of any enemy units, if a combat doctrine is active for your army, this unit gains the bonus of the Assault Doctrine, instead of the combat doctrine that is active.

  - Each time this unit fights, until that fight is resolved, add 1 to the Attacks characteristic of models in that unit. This is not cumulative with the additional attack granted by the Shock Assault ability.


  Passion:

  - This unit cannot Fall Back
