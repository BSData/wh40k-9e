      Witchfire: Select one enemy unit within 24" of and visible to this PSYKER and roll four D6: for each result of 5+, that unit suffers 1 mortal wound. If any models in that unit are destroyed as a result of those mortal wounds but that unit is not destroyed, keep repeating this process, reducing the number of dice rolled by 1 each time (e.g. three D6 on the first repeat, two D6 on the second repeat) until any of the following conditions are met:

      • The number of dice to roll is 0.

      • You roll no results of 5+.

      • No enemy models are destroyed.
