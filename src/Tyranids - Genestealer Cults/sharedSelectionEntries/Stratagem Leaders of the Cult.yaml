        value: Use this Stratagem before the battle, when mustering your army, if your WARLORD is a <CULT> PATRIARCH. Select up to two other <CULT> models with the HQ Battlefield Roll from your army and determine one Warlord Trait for each of them (these must be Warlord Traits they could have), those models are only regarded as your WARLORD for the purposes of those Warlord Traits. Each Warlord Trait in your army must be unique (if randomly generated, re-roll duplicate results). You can only use this Stratagem once.
