      Ambush markers are not units and cannot be targeted, attacked or destroyed. When measuring to or from ambush markers, always measure to the centre of the marker. If you are playing a mission that uses Concealed Deployment, the Concealed Deployment rules only apply to units that do not have the Cult Ambush ability. If you are playing a mission that uses Sentries, Sentry models cannot be set up in ambush, even if they have the Cult Ambush ability.


      If you have the first turn, you must reveal all of your ambush markers at the start of your Movement phase, one at a time, before moving any units. Each time you reveal an ambush marker, select one unit from your army that you set up in ambush, then set up one model from that unit within 1" of that ambush marker. Then remove that marker before setting up the rest of that model's unit wholly within 6" of the first model, wholly within your deployment zone and more than 9" from any enemy models (any models that cannot be placed are destroyed). If it is your turn, that unit can still move and shoot normally during the turn it is set up, but if it is a TRANSPORT, units that disembark from it this turn cannot be set up within 9" of any enemy models. Note that unless these units actually move during this Movement phase, they do not count as having moved in their Movement phase for any rules purposes, such as shooting Heavy weapons.


      If your opponent has the first turn, then none of their units can be set up or end a move within 9" of any of your ambush markers. At the end of your opponent's first Movement phase, after they have set up all of their units from reinforcements (if any), reveal all of your ambush markers as described above before continuing with the turn
