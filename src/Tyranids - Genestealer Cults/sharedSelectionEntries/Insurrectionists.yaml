        value: If your army is Battle-forged, all Troops units in GENESTEALER CULTS and BROOD BROTHERS Detachments gain this ability. A unit with this ability that is within range of an objective marker (as specified in the mission) controls it even if there are more enemy models within range of it. If an enemy unit within range of the objective marker has a similar ability, then it is controlled by the player who has the most models within range as normal.
