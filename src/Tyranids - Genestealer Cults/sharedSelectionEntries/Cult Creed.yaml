              Select one of the following cults: Cult of the Four-armed Emperor, the Hivecult, the Bladed Cog, the Rusted Claw, the Pauper Princes, the Twisted Helix.

              • Use the Cult Creed of the cult you selected, as listed on pages 56-61.

              • If a CHARACTER model with this Myriad Cult Creed gains a Warlord Trait, they can have the Cult Warlord Trait associated with the cult you selected, instead of of a Warlord Trait from page 70. If a CHARACTER has such a Warlord Trait, replace all instances of the <CULT> keyword on that Warlord Trait (e.g. TWISTED HELIX), if any, with the name of the Myriad Cult that this CHARACTER is from.

              • Unless the only units with this Myriad Cult are part of an Auxiliary Super, Super-heavy Auxiliary and/or Fortification Network Detachment, you will gain access to the Cult Stratagem associated with the cult you selected. When using such a Stratagem, replace all instances of the <CULT> keyword on that Stratagem (e.g. TWISTED HELIX), if any, with the Myriad Cult that the units with this Myriad Cult Creed have.

              • Unless the only units with this Myriad Cult are part of an Auxiliary Super, Super-heavy Auxiliary and/or Fortification Network Detachment, <CULT> PSYKER models with this Myriad Cult Creed know the psychic power associated with the cult you selected in addition to any other psychic powers they know. When using that psychic power, replace all instances of the <CULT> keyword on that psychic power (e.g. TWISTED HELIX), if any, with the Myriad Cult that the units with this Myriad Cult Creed have.

          All GENESTEALER CULTS units with this ability, and all models in them, gain a Cult Creed provided every unit in their Detachment that belongs to a cult belongs to the same cult. The Cult Creed gain depends on which cult they belong to, as shown on the following pages.


          If your cult does not have an associated Cult Creed, it is known as a Myriad Cult and you must instead create your own Cult Creed for them, as described on pages 62-63; this allows you to customise the rules for your Myriad Cult. In either case, write down all your Detachments' Cult Creeds on your army roster.
