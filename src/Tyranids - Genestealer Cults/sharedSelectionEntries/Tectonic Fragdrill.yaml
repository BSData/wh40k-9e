        value: Once per turn, in their Movement phase, one INFANTRY or BIKER unit with the Cult Ambush ability can move off the battlefield if all of its models are on the ground level and can move within 1" of this model (a unit cannot do so in the same phase that it arrived as reinforcements). If a unit does this, remove the selected unit from the battlefield. At the end of your next Movement phase, set up that unit anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9" away from any enemy models. If the battle ends before this unit is set back up, it is destroyed.

        value: After it is set up, a Tectonic Fragdrill is treated as a Sector Mechanicus terrain feature. It cannot move for any reason, is not treated as a friendly or enemy model, and cannot be targeted or affected by any attacks or abilities. Only INFANTRY, BEASTS, SWARMS and units that can FLY can be set up or end their move on the upper floors of a Sector Mechanicus Structure (any units can do so on the ground floor). Unless they can FLY, INFANTRY, BEASTS and SWARMS must scale ladders, girders or walls to ascend or descend between the different levels of a Sector Mechanicus structure. INFANTRY are also able to traverse around girders, buttresses and hanging chains, and so move through them without impediment. INFANTRY units that are entirely on a Sector Mechanicus Structure receive the benefit of cover if at least 50% of every model is obscured from the point of view of the shooting model.

        typeId: 21befb24-fc85-4f52-a745-64b2e48f8228
        value: If a model from your army is on a Tectonic Fragdrill at the end of your Movement phase, and there are no enemy models on it, you can activate the drill. If you do so, first roll a D6 for every unit on the ground level that is within 3" of the tip of this model's large drill; on a 6 that unit immediately suffers D6 mortal wounds. Then roll a D6, adding 1 to the result for each other time the drill on this model has been activated this battle. If the total is less than 6, the Seismic Tremors result below takes effect. On a 6+ the Seismic Tremors and Seismic Quake results below take effect. The Seismic Quake result can only take effect once per battle, regardless of how many Tectonic Fragdrills are on the battlefield.

        typeId: b2eb-4532-ac0a-1ec6
        value: Until the start of your next Movement phase, subtract 2 from charge rolls made for units whilst they are within 12" of this model. This does not apply to units that can FLY, and the effects of multiple Seismic Tremors are not cumulative.

        value: Draw a straight line, 1mm in thickness, from any point of one battlefield edge to any point of another battlefield edge in such a way that it crosses this model. Roll a D6 for every unit this line crosses that is on the ground level (do not roll for units that can FLY); on a 4+ that unit suffers D3 mortal wounds and its Move characteristic is halved until the end of its next Movement phase.
