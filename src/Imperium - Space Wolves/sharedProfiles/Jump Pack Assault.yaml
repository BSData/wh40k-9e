    value: If this model has a jump pack, when you set it up during deployment, it can be set up high in the skies, ready to strike, instead of being placed on the battlefield. If it is, it can  make a sudden assault to arrive on the battlefield at the end of any of your Movement phases; when it does so set it up anywhere that is more than 9" from any enemy models.
