          Use this Stratagem before the battle, when you are mustering your army. Select one ADEPTUS CUSTODES DREADNOUGHT unit from your army.


          - Add 1 to that unit's Attacks characteristics.

          - You can re-roll charge rolls made for that unit. If you could already re-roll charge rolls made for that unit (e.g. if it has the Instruments of the Emperor's Wrath fighting style on page 56) add 1 to charge rolls made for that unit instead.


          You can only use this Stratagem once.
