All ADEPTUS CUSTODES units with this ability, and all the models in them, gain a shield host fighting style so long as every unit in their Detachment that is assigned to a shield host is assigned to the same shield host. The fighting style gained depends upon which shield host they are assigned to, as shown on the following pages.
