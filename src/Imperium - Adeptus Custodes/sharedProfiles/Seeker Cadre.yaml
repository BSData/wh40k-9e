    value: At the start of the first battle round, before the first turn begins, this unit, or the ANATHEMA PSYKANA TRANSPORT it is embarked within, can make a Normal Move of up to 6" as if it were your Movement phase. This unit must end that move more than 9" away from any enemy models. If both players have units that can do this, the player who is taking the first turn moves their units first.
