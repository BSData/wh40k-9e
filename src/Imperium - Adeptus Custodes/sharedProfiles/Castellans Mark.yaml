    value: 'At the start of the first battle round, you can select up to two friendly <SHIELD HOST> units. Remove those units from the battlefield, then set them up anywhere on the battlefield that is wholly within your deployment zone. If the mission uses the Strategic Reserves rules (see the Warhammer 40,000 Core Book), any of those units can be placed into Strategic Reserves without having to spend any additional CPs, regardless of how many units are already in Strategic Reserves. If both players have abilities that redeploy units, roll off: the winner chooses who redeploys their units first.'
