    value: Use this Stratagem before the battle, when you are mustering your army, if your WARLORD has the ADEPTUS CUSTODES or ANATHEMA PSYKANA keyword. Select one ADEPTUS CUSTODES CHARACTER model from your army and give them one Relic of Terra, or select one ANATHEMA PSYKANA CHARACTER model from your army and give them one Relic of the Vigil. In either case, this must be a Relic they could have. Each Relic from your army must be unique, and you cannot use this Stratagem to give a model two Relics. You can only use this Stratagem once, unless you are playing Strike Force battle (in which case, you can use this Stratagem twice) or an Onslaught battle (in which case you can use this Stratagem three times).
