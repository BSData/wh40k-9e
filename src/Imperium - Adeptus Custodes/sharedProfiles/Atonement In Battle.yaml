      In your Charge phase, each time this unit declares a charge, you can only select the closet enemy unit as the target of its charge. 

      This unit is eligible to perform a Heroic Intervention as if it were a Character unit. 

      If this unit is able to perform a Heroic Intervention, it must do so. Each time a model in this unit makes a melee attack, you can re-roll a wound roll of 1.
