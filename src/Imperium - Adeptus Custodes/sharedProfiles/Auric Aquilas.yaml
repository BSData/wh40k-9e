      - You can re-roll charge rolls made for the bearer. If you could already re-roll charge rolls made by the bearer (e.g. the bear has the Instruments of the Emperor's Wrath fighting style on page 56), add 1 to charge rolls made for the bearer instead.

      - In your Movement phase, when the bearer is selected to move, it can boost. If it does so, until the end of the phase, double its Move characteristic, and it is not eligible to shoot or declare a charge with this turn.
