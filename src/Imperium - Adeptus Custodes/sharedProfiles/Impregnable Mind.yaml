      - In your opponent's Psychic phase, this WARLORD can attempt to Deny the Witch once as if it were a PSYKER model. Each time a Deny the Witch test is taken for this WARLORD, add 1 to the result.

      - This WARLORD counts as two additional models when determining control of an objective marker. This is cumulative with any other rules that make it count as additional models.
