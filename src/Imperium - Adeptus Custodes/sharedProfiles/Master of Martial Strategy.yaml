      While this WARLORD is on the battlefield, each time you spend a Command point to use a Stratagem, you can roll one D6: on a 5+, that command point is refunded.

      - Once per battle in the Command phase, if units from your army are using the Martial Ka'tah ability (pg 89), before selecting a ka'tah stance for your army, you can change the order of your martial ka'tahs, i.e. primary, secondary or tertiary. Note that this does not allow you to select ka'tah stances more than once.
