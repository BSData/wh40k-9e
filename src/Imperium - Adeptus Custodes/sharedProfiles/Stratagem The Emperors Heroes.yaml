    value: Use this Stratagem before the battle, when you are mustering your army, if your WARLORD has the ADEPTUS CUSTODES or ANATHEMA PSYKANA keyword. Select one ADEPTUS CUSTODES CHARACTER model or one ANATHEMA PSYKANA CHARACTER model from your army and determine one Warlord Trait for it (this must be a Warlord Trait it can have); that model is only regarded as your WARLORD for the purposes of that Warlord Trait. Each Warlord Trait from your army must be unique (if randomly generated, re-roll duplicate results), and you cannot use this Stratagem to give a model two Warlord Traits. You can only use this Stratagem once, unless you are playing a Strike Force battle (in which case, you can use this Stratagem twice) or an Onslaught battle (in which case, you can use this Stratagem three times).
