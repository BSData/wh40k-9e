      - Add 1 to the bearer's Toughness characteristic.

      - Once per battle, in the Heroic Interventions step of your opponent's Charge phase, if the bearer is not within Engagement Range of any enemy units, it can perform a teleport-shunt. Remove the bearer from the battlefield and set it up within 3" of a friendly unit (excluding VEHICLE units) and within Engagement Ragne of an enemy unit. If that is not possible, it cannot perform the teleport-shunt. The bearer cannot perform a Heroic Intervention int he same turn in which is performs a teleport-shunt.
