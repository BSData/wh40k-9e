    value: At the start of the Fight phase, if this model is within Engagement Range of any enemy units, it fights first that phase. In addition, if this model is destroyed in the Fight phase before it has been selected to fight in that phase, do not remove it from play - it can fight after the attacking model's unit has finished making its attacks. After resolving this model's attacks, it is then removed.
