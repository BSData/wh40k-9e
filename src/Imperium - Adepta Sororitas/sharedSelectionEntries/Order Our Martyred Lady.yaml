          - At the end of any phase (other than the Morale phase) in which any units with this conviction were destroyed, you gain 1 Miracle dice (pg 91). This is in addition to any Miracle dice gained at the end of a phase in which a CHARACTER unit with this conviction was destroyed (see Sacrifice, page 91).

          - Each time an attack is made by a model with this conviction, if this unit is below its Starting Strength, add 1 to that attack's hit roll.
