        value: Use this Stratagem before the battle, when you are mustering your army, if your WARLORD has the ADEPTUS MINISTORUM keyword. Select one ADEPTUS MINISTORM CHARACTER model from your army (excluding named characters) and determine one Warlord Trait for it (this must be a Warlord Trait that it can have); that model is only regarded as your WARLORD for the purposes of that Warlord Trait. Each Warlord Trait in your army must be unique (if randomly generated, re-roll duplicate results), and you cannot use this Stratagem to give a model two Warlord Traits. You can use this Stratagem once, unless you are playing a Strike Force battle (in which case, you can use this Stratagem twice) or an Onslaught battle (in which case, you can use this Stratagem three times).
