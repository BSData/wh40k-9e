        value: Once per battle, at the start of any phase, you can roll two D6 and discard one of them. The value of the remaining dice is the value of this unit's Cherub dice. Until the end of the phase, this unit can perform one Act of Faith (pg 91) using that Cherub dice as if it were a Miracle dice. If a unit has a Cherub dice at the end of the phase, it is discarded.
