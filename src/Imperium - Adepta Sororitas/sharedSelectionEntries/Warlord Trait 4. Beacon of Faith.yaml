        value: At the start of your Command phase, if this WARLORD is on the battlefield, you gain 1 Miracle dice. This Miracle dice can only be used when your WARLORD performs an Act of Faith or uses a Miraculous ability and if not used by the start of your next Command phase, it is discarded. This Miracle dice can be used to perform an Act of Faith even if another unit from your army has already performed an Act of Faith this phase.
