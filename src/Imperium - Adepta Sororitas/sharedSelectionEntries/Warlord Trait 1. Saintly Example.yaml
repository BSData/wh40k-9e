          - In addition to this Warlord Trait, this WARLORD has one randomly generated Warlord Trait from the Adepta Sororitas Warlord traits table in Codex: Adepta Sororitas. Each Warlord Trait in your army must be unique, so re-roll duplicate results.

          - If this WARLORD is destroyed, you can immediately select another ORDER OF OUR MARTYRED LADY CHARACTER model from your army that does not have a Warlord Trait. Then, select a Warlord Trait that no model in your army has (this must be a Warlord Trait that the model you just selected can have, and it cannot be Saintly Example). Until the end of the battle, that model gains that Warlord Trait and for all rules purposes now counts as your WARLORD. If any mission objective, secondary objective or Agenda rules are triggered when your WARLORD is destroyed, those rules are not triggered until after the new WARLORD is destroyed.
