        value: Use this Stratagem before the battle. Select one ADEPTA SORORITAS model (excluding CHARACTER models) in your army that has the word 'Superior' in their profile. That model can have one of the following Relics of the Ecclesiarchy (pg 74-75), even though they are not a CHARACTER model. Blessings of Sebastian Thor; The Ecclesiarch's Fury; Litanies of Faith; Redemption. Each Relic in your army must be unique, and you cannot use this Stratagem to give a model two Relics. You can use this Stratagem once, unless you are playing a Strike Force battle (in which case, you can use this Stratagem twice) or an Onslaught battle (in which case, you can use this Stratagem three times).
