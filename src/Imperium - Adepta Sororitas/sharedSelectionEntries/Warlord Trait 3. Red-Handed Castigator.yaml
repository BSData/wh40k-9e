          - Each time you gain a Miracle dice (see Codex: Adepta Sororitas)  at the end of a phase as a result of the Vengeance ability, if this WARLORD destroyed any enemy units during that phase, that Miracle dice is automatically a 6.

          - Each time this WARLORD makes a melee attack, if this WARLORD made a charge move, was charged or performed a Heroic Intervention this turn, you can re-roll that attack's hit roll.
