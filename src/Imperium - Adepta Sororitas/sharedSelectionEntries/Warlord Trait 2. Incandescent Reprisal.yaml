          - Each time this WARLORD would lose a wound, roll one D6: on a 5+, that wound is not lost.

          - Once per phase, after an enemy unit shoots or fights, if this WARLORD suffered any wounds as a result of those attacks:

          -- If this WARLORD is not within Engagement Range of any enemy units, this WARLORD can shoot with one ranged weapon it is equipped with. It can only target that enemy unit when doing so, and only if that enemy unit is an eligible target.

          -- If this WARLORD is within Engagement Range of any enemy units and has not already been selected to fight during this phase, it can immediately be selected to fight. It can only target that enemy unit when doing so, and only if that enemy unit is an eligible target.
