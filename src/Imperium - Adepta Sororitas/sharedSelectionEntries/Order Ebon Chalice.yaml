          - If any units in your army have this conviction, when you are determining which sacred rites (pg 93) are active for your army after you have determined your mission, you cannot randomly select two sacred rites. Instead, after you have selected one sacred rite you must then select a second. Both of these sacred rites are active for units from your army with this conviction (only the first is active for other units from your army with the Sacred Rites ability).

          - Each time a model or unit with this conviction performs an Act of Faith (pg 91), you can first discard 1 Miracle dice. If you do so, 1 Miracle dice you use in that Act of Faith is considered to be a 6 (irrespective of its actual value).
