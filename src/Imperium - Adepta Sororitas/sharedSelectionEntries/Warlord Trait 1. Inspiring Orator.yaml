        value: 'Each time this WARLORD intones a hymn or uses an ability in your Command phase that specifies a range, you can add 3" to the range of that hymn or ability. This does not affect the Miracle range of any abilities. This WARLORD has the following ability: Inspiring Orator (Aura): While a friendly <ORDER> CORE unit is within 6" of this WARLORD, that unit ignores the Combat Attrition penalty for being below Half-strength.'
