    value: Models in this unit have a 6+ invulnerable save. In addition, one model in this unit can attempt to resist one psychic power in your opponent's Psychic phase in the same manner as a PSYKER by taking a Deny the Witch test, if that model is within 24" of the enemy model manifesting that psychic power. When taking that Deny the Witch test, roll one D6 instead of 2D6; the psychic power is resisted if the roll is greater than the result of the Psychic test that manifested the power.
