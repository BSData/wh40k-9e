    value: The first time CELESTINE is destroyed, roll one D6 at the end of the phase instead of using any rules that are triggered when a model is destroyed. On a 1, this unit counts as having been destroyed for the purposes of Sacrifice; on a 2+, set CELESTINE back up on the battlefield as close as possible to where she was destroyed and not within Engagement Range of any enemy units, with all her wound remaining.
