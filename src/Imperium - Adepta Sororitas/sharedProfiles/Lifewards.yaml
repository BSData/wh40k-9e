    value: While this unit contains any GEMINAE SUPERIA models, each time an attack successfully wounds this unit, that attack must be allocated to one of those models. The destruction of GEMINAE SUPERIA models is ignored for the purposes of Morale tests. If CELESTINE is ever destroyed, any remaining GEMINAE SUPERIA models in this unit are also destroyed.
