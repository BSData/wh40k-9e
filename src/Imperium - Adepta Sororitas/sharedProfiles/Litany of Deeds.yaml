    value: This model gains an ability (see below) depending on which tale it is recounting. At the start of the battle, before the first turn begins, you must select one tale from the following list for this model to recount, and make a note of it on your army roster. You cannot select a tale that another model from your army is already recounting unless all three tales are being countered by models from your army. Until the end of the battle, this model has the ability associated with that tale.
