  One Miracle Die is generated at the start of each Player Turn.


  Once per phase, one unit from your army with this ability can perform one Act of Faith using Miracle dice on the following dice rolls:

  Advance, Charge, Hit, Wound, Saving throw, Damage; Morale test


  There's an ENTIRE PAGE of rules for Acts of Faith/Miracle dice in the Codex on page 91. I'm not typing that in, and you should have them memorized by now, anyway.
