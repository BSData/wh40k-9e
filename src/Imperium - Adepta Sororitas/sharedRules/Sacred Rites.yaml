description: >
  This unit gains a bonus depending on which sacred rites are active for your army. After players have determined their mission, you must select one sacred rite from the following table to be active for your army. Alternatively, you can randomly determine two sacred rites from the table to be active for your army by rolling two D6 and looking up the results (if a double is rolled, roll both dice again until two different results are rolled). In either case, these sacred rites are active for your army until the end of the battle. Some rules can make additional sacred rites become active for a unit during the battle. Duplicated active sacred rites on that unit have no additional effect.


  1. Hand of the Emperor:

  While this sacred rite is active, add 1 to Advance rolls and charge rolls made for this unit.


  2. Spirit of the Martyr:

  While this sacred rite is active, each time a model in this unit is destroyed by a melee attack and does not explode, roll one D6, on a 6, after the attacking model's unit has finished making its attacks, it suffers 1 mortal wound (a unit can suffer a maximum of 6 mortal wounds per phase as the result of this ability).


  3. Aegis of the Emperor:

  While this sacred rite is active, each time this units uses its Shield of Faith ability to take a Deny the Witch test, if the result of that test was an unmodified result of 5+, or it it was greater than the result of the Psychic test, that Deny the Witch test is passed.


  4. Divine Guidance:

  While this sacred rite is active, each time a model in this units makes a ranged attack, on an unmodified wound roll of 6, the Armour Penetration characteristic of that attack is improved by 1.


  5. The Passion:

  While this sacred rite is active, each time a model in this unit makes a melee attack, an unmodified hit roll of 6 scores 1 additional hit.


  6. Light of the Emperor:

  While this sacred rite is active, you can ignore any or all modifiers to this unit's Leadership characteristic, and each time a Combat Attrition test is taken for this unit, you can ignore any or all modifiers.
