  - Models in this unit have a 5+ invulnerable save.
   - Each time a model in this unit would lose a wound as the result of a mortal wound, roll one D6: on a 5+ that wound is not lost.
  - At the start of the first battle round, before the first turn begins, models in this unit can make a Normal Move of up to 6". They cannot end this move within 9" of any enemy models. If both players have units that can do this, the player who is taking the first turn moves their models first.
