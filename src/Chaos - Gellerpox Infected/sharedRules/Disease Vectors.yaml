description: If your army is Battle-forged, you can include one GELLERPOX INFECTED unit and one MUTOID VERMIN unit in each DEATH GUARD or NURGLE TRAITORIS ASTARTES Patrol, Battalion and Brigade Detachment in your army without those units taking up Battlefield Role slots in those Detachments. The inclusion of these units does not prevent other units from their Detachment benefiting from Detachment abilities (e.g. Let the Galaxy Burn), and it does not prevent other units from your army benefiting from abilities that require every model in your army to have that ability. Units included in a Patrol, Battalion or Brigade Detachment in this manner are ignored for any rules that state all units from that Detachment must have at least one Faction keyword in common (e.g. in a matched play game), and when determining your Army Faction.
