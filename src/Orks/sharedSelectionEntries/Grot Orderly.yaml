          Once per battle, if a 1 is rolled when using the bearer's Sawbonez ability you can re-roll the dice.

          We recommend placing a Grot Orderly model next to the unit as a reminder, removing it once this ability has been used (a Grot Orderly does not count as a model for any rules purposes).
