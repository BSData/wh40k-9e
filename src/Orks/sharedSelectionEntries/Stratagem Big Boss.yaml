        value: Use this Stratagem before the battle, when you are mustering your army, if your WARLORD has the ORKS keyword. Select one ORKS CHARACTER from your army and determine one Warlord Trait for that model (this must be a Warlord Trait they could have); that model it is only regarded as your WARLORD for the purposes of that Warlord Trait. Each Warlord Trait in your army must be unique (if randomly generated, re-roll duplicate results), and you cannot use this Stratagem to give a model two Warlord Traits. You can only use this Stratagem once, unless you are playing a Strike Force battle (in which case you can use this Stratagem twice) or an Onslaught battle (in which case, you can use this Stratagem three times).
