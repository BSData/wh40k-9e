    value: At the end of the Reinforcements step of your opponent's Movement phase, if an enemy unit was set up as Reinforcements this turn within 12" of the bearer, you can select one BLOOD AXES CORE unit from your army that is not within Engagement Range of any enemy units and is within 6" of the bearer. That BLOOD AXES unit can declare a charge as if it were your Charge phase, but its models can only declare that enemy unit as the target of that charge. Add 2 to that charge roll.
