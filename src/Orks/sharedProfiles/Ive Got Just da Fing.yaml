      MEK and BIG MEK units in your army can attempt the following action:


      Kustomise (Action): Once per battle round, at the end of your Movement phase, select one MEK or BIG MEK unit from your army that is within 1" of the Mekboy Workbench, then select one ORKS VEHICLE (excluding TITANIC units) that is within 3" of this Mekboy Workbench. That VEHICLE unit must remain within 3" of that Mekboy Workbench until the action is completed. The action is completed at the end of your turn. Once completed, select one Kustom Job (pg 60-61) that VEHICLE unit is eligible for, including the normal restrictions of how many of each Kustom Job can be included in your army (see I'll Av Wot E's Avin!, opposite). That VEHICLE unit gains the selected Kustom Job (Do not icnrease the model's Power Rating or points value). At the end of each battle round, roll one D6 for each Kustom Job gained from the ability; on a 1, that Kustom Job falls off again and cannot be used by or selected for that model for the rest of the battle.
