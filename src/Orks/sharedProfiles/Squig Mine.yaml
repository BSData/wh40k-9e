    value: Once per turn, at the end of your Movement phase, if this unit has any squig mines remaining, this unit can release one. Select one enemy VEHICLE unit that is within 6" of this unit and roll one D6; on a 3-5, that unit suffers D3 mortal wounds. On a 6, that unit suffers D6 mortal wounds instead. The number of squigmines this unit is equipped with is then reduced by 1.
