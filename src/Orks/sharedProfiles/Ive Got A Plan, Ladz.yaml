    value: 'At the end of the Deploy Armies step, select up to three BLOOD AXES units from your army and redeploy them.  IF the mission uses the Strategic Reserves rules, any of those units can be placed into Strategic Reserves without having to spend any additional CPs, regardless of how many units are already in Strategic Reserves.  If both players have abilities that redeploy units, roll off: the winner chooses who redeploys their units first.'
