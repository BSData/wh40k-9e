          Select one melee weapon (excluding Relics) the bearer is equipped with.

          - That weapon is now a Relic for all rules purposes and has the Daemon Weapon ability.

          - Each time an attack is made with this daemon weapon, if a hit is scored, that attack automatically wounds the target and enemy models cannot use any rules to ignore the wounds they lose.
