          - Each time this WARLORD loses a wound, add 1 to its Attacks characteristic (to a maximum of +3). Each time this WARLORD regains a lost wound, subtract 1 from its Attacks characteristic.

          - When this WARLORD is destroyed, if it is within Engagement Range of any enemy units and it has not already fought this phase, do not remove it from play: it can, after the attacking model's unit has finished making its attacks, be selected to fight. After that fight has been resolved, this WARLORD is then removed from play.
