        value: At the start of the first battle round but before the first turn has begun, you must nominate one enemy CHARACTER to be the target of the bearer of the Murder Sword (this can be a character not yet set up on the battlefield). Remember to tell your opponent which character you have nominated. Each attack made with the Murder Sword that hits the selected character automatically inflicts a mortal wound upon that character instead of the normal damage.
