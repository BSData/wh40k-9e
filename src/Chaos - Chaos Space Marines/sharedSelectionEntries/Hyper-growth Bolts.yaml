          Model with a bolt weapon only. When you give a model this Relic, select one bolt weapon that the bearer is equipped with:

          - That weapon is considered to be a Relic for all rules purposes.

          - Each time the bearer is selected to shoot, you can choose for that weapon to fire a hyper-growth bolt. If you do so, the bearer can only make one attack with that weapon this phase, but if that attack scores a hit, unless the target is a VEHICLE unit, it automatically wounds the target, has an Armour Penetration characteristic of -1, and has a Damage characteristic of D3+3.
