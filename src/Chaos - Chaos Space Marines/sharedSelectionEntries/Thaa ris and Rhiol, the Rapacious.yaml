          Select two melee weapons (excluding Relics) the bearer is equipped with.

          - Those weapons are now both Relics for all rules purposes and have the Daemon Weapon ability. This model only counts as being equipped with one Relic, however.

          - Each time the bearer is selected to fight, it can make an additional D3 attacks with each of these daemon weapons (roll separately for each).
