        value: In your Command phase, you can select one friendly BLACK LEGION unit within 6" of this WARLORD. Until the start of your next Command phase, each time a model in that unit makes an attack, if your army is engaged in Wanton Destruction or Wanton Slaughter, that unit is considered to be engaged in Wanton Massacre for that attack instead.
