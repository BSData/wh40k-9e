          - Each time an attack is allocated to the bearer, worsen the Armour Penetration characteristic of that attack by 1.

          - Once per battle, in your Movement phase, if the bearer did not arrive as Reinforcements this turn, it can use this Relic. If it does so, the bearer and up to one friendly BLACK LEGION CORE unit within 3" of the bearer can be removed from the battlefield and set back up anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9" away from any enemy models. If two units are set back up on the battlefield using this Relic, they must be set up within 6" of each other.
