              - After nominating this model to be your WARLORD, randomly determine one additional Warlord Trait for them (re-rolling duplicate results) from a Warlord Traits table of your choice that this model has access to.

              - If this WARLORD is destroyed, you can immediately select one other ALPHA LEGION CHARACTER model from your army that does not have a Warlord Trait, and select a Warlord Trait for that model to gain (this must be a Warlord Trait no other model from your army has, it must be one that model can have, and it cannot be I Am Alpharius). Until the end of the game, that model counts as your WARLORD for all rules purposes. If any mission objective, secondary objective or Agenda rules are triggered when your WARLORD is destroyed, those rules are not trigged until this new WARLORD is destroyed.

Remove those units from the battlefield, then set them up anywhere on the battlefield that is wholly within your deployment zone and more than 9" away from any enemy models. If the mission uses the Strategic Reserves rules, any of those units can be placed into Strategic Reserves without having to spend any additional CPs, regardless of how many units are already in Strategic Reserves.

              - Improve the Armour Penetration characteristic of that attack by 1.
