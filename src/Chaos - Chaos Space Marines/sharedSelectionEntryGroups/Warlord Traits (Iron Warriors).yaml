              In your Command phase, you can select one friendly IRON WARRIORS CORE unit within 6" of this WARLORD. Until the start of your next Command phase:

              - Each time an enemy unit declares a charge against that unit, if that unit is not within Engagement Range of any enemy units, it can either Hold Steady or Set to Defend.

              - That unit has the Objective Secured ability. If a model that unit already has that ability, that model counts as one additional model when determining control of an objective marker.
