          • Each time a model in that unit makes an attack, if the Tactical Doctrine is active for your army, then the Devastator Doctrine is considered to be active for that attack instead.

          • Each time a model in that unit makes an attack, if the Assault Doctrine is active for your army, then the Tactical Doctrine is considered to be active for that attack instead.
