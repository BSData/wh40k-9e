        value: When this WARLORD is destroyed, if it does not explode, you can use this Warlord Trait instead of using any other abilities that take effect as a result of this model being destroyed (e.g. Astartes Banner). If you do, this WARLORD is not removed from play until the start of the next turn or the end of the battle (whichever comes first). Until that happens, it is still considered to be in play, but any further wounds this WARLORD would lose are not lost.
