description: While the Tactical Doctrine is active for your army, INFANTRY models from your army (excluding DEATHWING models) can make attacks with Rapid Fire and Assault Weapons (excluding Blast weapons) while within Engagement Range of enemy units, but must target an enemy unit that is within Engagement Range of its own unit when they do so. In such circumstances, the model can target an enemy unit even if other friendly units are within Engagement Range of the same enemy unit, and while it is making such an attack, it has a Ballistic Skill characteristic of 5+.
