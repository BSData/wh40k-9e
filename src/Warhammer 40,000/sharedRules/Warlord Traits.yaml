  If your Warlord is a CHARACTER, it can use a Warlord Trait. Immediately before either player starts to deploy their army, you can roll a D3 on the Warlord Trait table here to determine what Warlord Trait your Warlord has. Alternatively, choose the trait that most suits your Warlord's temperament or style of war.


  1) Legendary Fighter: If this Warlord charges in the Charge phase, add 1 to their Attacks characteristic until the end of the ensuing Fight phase.


  2) Inspiring Leader: Friendly units within 6" of this Warlord can add 1 to their Leadership characteristic.


  3) Tenacious Survivor: Roll a dice each time this Warlord loses a wound.  On a 6, the Warlord shrugs off the damage and does not lose the wound.
