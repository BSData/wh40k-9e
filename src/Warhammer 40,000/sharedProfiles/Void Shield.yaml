    value: "Each hit scored against the model will instead hit a void shield (whilst they remain). Close combat attacks come from inside the shield and therefore are not stopped. Void shields have an Armour Value of 12. A glancing or penetrating hit (or any hit from a Destroyer weapon) scored against a void shield causes it to collapse. After all the void shields have collapsed, further hits strike the model instead. At the end of each of the controlling player's turns, roll one dice for each collapsed void  shield: each roll of 5+ instantly restores one collapsed shield.  If a weapon uses a template or blast marker and it hits one or more units protected by a Void Shield Zone, ignore the number of hits it would normally cause to the units & instead roll to pen the void shield once using the weapons normal rules & profile for each template or blast marker that hits."
