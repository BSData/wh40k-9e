    value: Unless a friendly unit is embarked aboard this model, this model's weapons can only target the closest visible enemy unit. Attacks made with the Icarus Lascannon can instead target the closest visible enemy unit that can FLY. In either case, if two or more units are equally close, you may choose which is targeted.
