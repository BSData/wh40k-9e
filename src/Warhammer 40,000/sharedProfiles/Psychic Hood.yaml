    value: Each time a unit (or model) is targeted by an enemy psychic power and is within 12" of a friendly model with a psychic hood, the wearer of the hood can attempt to Deny the Witch in their stead, as if he were in the target unit.  If the Deny the Witch attempt is failed, the psychic power is resolved as normal, but affects only the initial target, not the wearer of the hood.  If a model with a psychic hood is embarked in a vehicle or building, he can only use the hood to nullify powers targeting the vehicle or building he is embarked within.
