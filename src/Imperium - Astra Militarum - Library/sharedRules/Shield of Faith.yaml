description: Models in this unit have a 6+ invulnerable save. In addition, this unit can attempt to deny one psychic power in each enemy Psychic phase in the same manner as a PSYKER. However, if it does so, instead of rolling 2D6, only roll a single D6; the psychic power is resisted if the roll is greater than the result of the Psychic test that manifested the power. When attempting to deny a psychic power, first select a model in the unit â€“ measure range, visibility etc. from this model.
