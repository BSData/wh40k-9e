  If this model is within Engagement Range of any enemy units, it can still target and resolve attacks against enemy units that are not within Engagement Range of it with weapons with this ability. Note that when making such attacks, you must still subtract 1 from hit rolls due to enemy models being within Engagement Range


  Each time this model makes an attack with this weapon, add 1 to that attack's hit roll
