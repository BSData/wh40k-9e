              Malediction: If manifested, select one enemy unit within 18" of this Psyker. Until the end of your next Command phase:


              -Subtract 2 from the Leadership characteristic of models in that unit.

              -Your opponent cannot select that unit for the Insane Bravery Stratagem, nor can they use any rule that would enable them to re-roll a Morale test taken for that unit.


              In addition, roll 2D6: if the result is equal to or greater than that unit's Leadership characteristic (after applying the modifier above), any action that unit is currently performing immediately fails and, until the start of your next Psychic phase, that unit cannot perform actions
