description: If, in your movement phase, an OFFICER from your army disembarks from a TRANSPORT model, after that OFFICER's unit has been set up it can issue Orders as if it were your Command phase. However, when doing so, the Regimental Tactics ability does not apply, even if every model from your army has the ASTRA MILITARUM keyword. Note that an OFFICER model cannot issue Orders in this when disembarking from a destroyed TRANSPORT model.
