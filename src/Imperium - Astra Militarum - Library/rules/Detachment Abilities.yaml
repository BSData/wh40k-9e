  - If Every unit in an ASTRA MILITARUM Detachment has the MILITARUM TEMPESTUS, OFFICIO PREFECTUS and/or MILITARUM AUXILLA keywords, TEMPESTUS SCIONS units in that Detachment have the Troops Battlefield Role, instead of Elites


  - Troops units in ASTRA MILITARUM Detachments gain the Objective Secured ability (this ability is described in the Warhammer 40,000 Core Book).
