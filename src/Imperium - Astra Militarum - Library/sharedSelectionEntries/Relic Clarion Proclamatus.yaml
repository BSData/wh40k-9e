        value: COMMAND SQUAD model equipped with master vox only. Each time an OFFICER in the bearer's unit issues an Order, when selecting a target for that Order, you can ignore the range restriction for that type of Order, but if you do so, you can only select a unit with the VOX-CASTER keyword as the target for that Order (all other rules for issuing Orders still apply).
