      Units with this doctrine gain the Mechanised Keyword.


      Units with this doctrine can disembark from a Transport model (excluding after Aircraft models) that model has made a Normal Move, but if they do so such units can not be selected to move again this phase (though they are still counted as having moved) and neither they nor that Transport are eligible to declare a charge this turn.
