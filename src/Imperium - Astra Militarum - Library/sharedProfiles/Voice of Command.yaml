    value: "In your Command phase, ASTRA MILITARUM OFFICERS from your army can issue Orders. There are three types of Orders\n- Regimental Orders, Prefectus Orders and Mechanised Orders. The Commanding Authority section of each OFFICER's datasheet will specify which types of Orders that OFFICER knows, and how many Orders it can issue per turn\n \nEach time an OFFICER issues an Order, you must select one of the Orders it knows. This can be an Order that was already issued by another friendly OFFICER this turn, but the same OFFICER cannot attempt to issue the same Order more than once in the same battle round.\n\nYou must then select a target unit for that Order to be issued to. If issuing a Regimental or Prefectus Order, select one friendly PLATOON unit within 6 of that OFFICER'S unit. If issuing a Mechanised Order, select one friendly SQUADRON unit within 12 of that OFFICER'S unit\n\nThe unit you selected is then affected by that Order. A unit can only be affected by one Order at a time. If a unit is being affected by an Order when it is selected to be affected by another Order, the new Order immediately replaces the old one."
