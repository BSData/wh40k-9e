    value: The bearer gains the VOX-CASTER keyword. Each time an OFFICER in the bearer's unit issues an order, you can increase the range at which that order can be issued to 24", but only if you select a friendly VOX-CASTER unit to issue that order to (all other rules for issuing an order still apply).
