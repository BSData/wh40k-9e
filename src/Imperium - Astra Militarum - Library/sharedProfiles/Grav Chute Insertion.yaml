      In your Movement phase, when this Transport model makes a Normal Move, one or more units embarked within it can disembark at any point during that move. If they do so:


      - Models in those units must be set up more than 9" away from any enemy models. Militarum Tempestus models in those units must be set up more than 6" away from any enemy models.

      - If this Transport model moves 20" or more this phase, roll one D6 for each model that disembarks using this ability (excluding Militarum Tempestus models( before setting that model up. On a 1, that model is destroyed.

      - Models in those units count as having made a Normal Move this phase they cannon move further this phase and can never use rules that would allow them to count as Remained Stationary this turn. In addition, those units cannot declare a charge this turn, but can otherwise act normally (shoot, fight, etc) this turn.
