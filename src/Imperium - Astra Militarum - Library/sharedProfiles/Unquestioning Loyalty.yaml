    value: 'Each time a saving throw made for a <CULT> CHARACTER model from your army is failed, you can select one other friendly <CULT> or BROOD BROTHERS model with this ability within 3" of that CHARACTER model and take an Unquestioning Loyalty test. To do so, roll one D6, adding 1 to the result if that CHARACTER model is a PATRIARCH model: on a 4+, the test is passed and that CHARACTER model does not suffer damage. Instead, the friendly model you selected is destroyed and the attack sequence ends.'
