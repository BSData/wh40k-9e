        value: Once per battle, in your Command phase, the bearer can activate this item of Cryptek Arkana.  If it does, select one point on the battlefield anywhere within 24" of the bearer and place a marker on that point.  At the start of your next Command phase, roll one D6 for each unit within 6" of the centre of that marker, subtracting 1 if the unit being rolled for is a CHARACTER.  On a 4-5, that unit suffers D3 mortal wounds, and on a 6, that unit suffers 3 mortal wounds. The marker is then removed.
