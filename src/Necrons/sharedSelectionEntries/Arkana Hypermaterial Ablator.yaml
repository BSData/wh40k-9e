        value: In your Command phase, you can select one friendly <DYNASTY> CORE or <DYNASTY> CANOPTEK unit within 9" of the bearer. Until the start of your next Command phase, each time a ranged attack is made against that unit, if the attacker is more than 12" away, then the unit you selected is treated as having the benefits of light cover.
