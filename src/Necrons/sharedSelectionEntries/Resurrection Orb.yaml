        value: Once per battle, in your Command phase, the bearer can use its resurrection orb. If it does, select one friendly <DYNASTY> unit within 6" of the bearer that is not at its Starting Strength and has not had its reanimation protocols enacted this phase. That unit's reanimation protocols are enacted, and every destroyed model in that unit begins to reassemble.
