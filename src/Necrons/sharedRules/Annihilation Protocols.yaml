  If your army is an Annihilation Legion and you select a SKORPEKH LORD or LOKHUST LORD model to be your WARLORD, this unit is eligible to benefit from this ability and the following rules apply.


  After both sides have deployed, but before you have determined who will have the first turn, you must assign a different annihilation protocol to each of the first five battle rounds, and note this down secretly on your army roster.


  At the start of each battle round, if any SKORPEKH LORD or LOKHUST LORD units from your army are on the battlefield, the annihilation protocol that you assigned to that battle round becomes active for your army until the end of that battle round. Each annihilation protocol is made up of two directives. When an annihilation protocol becomes active for your army, reveal it to your opponent and select one of its directives. Until the assigned annihilation protocol stops being active, while a unit that is eligible to benefit from this ability is within 6" of a friendly SKORPEKH LORD or LOKHUST LORD model, that unit benefits from the selected directive.


  If the battle lasts for more than five battle rounds, then until the end of the battle, whichever annihilation protocol was active in the fifth battle round remains active.
