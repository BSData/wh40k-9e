  If every unit from your army (excluding DYNASTIC AGENT, C'TAN SHARD and UNALIGNED units) is from the same dynasty, and you select a NECRONS CHARACTER model to be your WARLORD, this unit is eligible to benefit from this ability and the following rules apply.  


  After both sides have deployed, but before you have determined who will have the first turn, you must assign a different one of the command protocols to each of the first five battle rounds, and note this down secretly on your army roster.


  At the start of each battle round, if any NECRONS CHARACTER units from your army are on the battlefield, the command protocol that you assigned to that battle round becomes active for your army until the end of that battle round. Each command protocol is made up of two directives. When a command protocol becomes active for your army, reveal it to your opponent and select one of its directives.  Until the assigned command protocol stops being active, while a unit that is eligible to benefit from this ability is on the battlefield, that unit benefits from the selected directive.


  In addition, if all units from your army are from the same dynasty (excluding DYNASTIC AGENT, C'TAN SHARD and UNALIGNED units), select one command protocol that has not been assigned to a battle round (there will typically only be one). That command protocol is active in every battle round in addition to the one assigned to that battle round – select which directive your units will benefit from at the start of each battle round. Note that if this additional command protocol is the one described in your dynasty’s code, this means both of its directives apply to all units with this ability in your army in every battle round, in addition to the protocol assigned to that battle round.
