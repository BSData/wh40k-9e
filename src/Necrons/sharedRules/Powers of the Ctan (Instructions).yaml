  Before the battle, generate the Powers of the C'tan for C'TAN SHARD units from your army using the table below. You can either roll one D6 to generate each power randomly (re-rolling duplicate results), or you can select which powers each unit knows. If selecting powers, a power cannot be selected for a second time until all other powers have been selected at least once by units in your army, and no unit can know the same power more than once. Write down any Powers of the C'tan your units know on your army roster.


  1) Antimatter Meteor

  2) Time's Arrow

  3) Sky of Falling Stars

  4) Cosmic Fire

  5) Seismic Assault

  6) Transdimensional Thunderbolt
