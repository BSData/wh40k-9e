    value: Models with this code have a 6+ invulnerable save. Each time a unit with this code Advances, it can translocate. If it does, do not make an Advance roll for it. Instead until the end of the phase, add 6" to the Move characteristic of models in that unit. If a unit translocates, until the end of the turn, models in that unit cannot shoot. Each time a unit with this code Falls Back or translocates, until the end of the phase, models in that unit can move across models and terrain as if they were not there. When the Protocol of the Sudden Storm becomes active for your army, if every unit in your army (excluding DYNASTIC AGENT and C'TAN SHARD units) has this code, you can select both of that command protocol's directives instead of just one.
