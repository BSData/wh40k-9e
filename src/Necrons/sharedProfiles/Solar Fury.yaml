    value: Add 3" to the Range characteristic of ranged weapons (excluding Pistols) that models with this code are equipped with.  Each time a model with this code makes a ranged attack that targets a unit within half range, the Armour Penetration characteristic of that attack is improved by 1.  When the Protocol of the Vengeful Stars becomes active for your army, if every unit in your army (excluding DYNASTIC AGENT and C'TAN SHARD units) has this code, you can select both of that command protocol's directives instead of just one.
