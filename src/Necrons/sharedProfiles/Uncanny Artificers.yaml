    value: Each time a model with this code would lose a wound as the result of a mortal wound, roll one D6; on a 5+ that wound is not lost.  Each time a unit with this code is selected to shoot or fight, you can re-roll one wound roll when making that unit's attacks.  When the Protocol of the Undying Legions becomes active for your army, if every unit in your army (excluding DYNASTIC AGENT and C'TAN SHARD units) has this code, you can select both of that command protocol's directives instead of just one.
