    value: Add 1 to the charge rolls made for units with this code. Each time a model with this code makes a melee attack, if that model's unit made a charge move, was charged, or performed a Heroic Intervention this turn, improve the Armour Penetration characteristic of that attack by 1. When the Protocol of the Hungry Void becomes active for your army, if every unit in your army (excluding DYNASTIC AGENT and C'TAN SHARD units) has this code, you can select both of that command protocol's directives instead of just one.
