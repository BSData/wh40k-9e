    value: Each time a Morale test is taken for a unit with this code, you can re-roll that test.  Instead of following the normal rules for Rapid Fire weapons, models with this code shooting Rapid Fire weapons make double the number of attacks if the shooting model's target is within 18".  When the Protocol of the Conquering Tyrant becomes active for your army, if every unit in your army (excluding DYNASTIC AGENT and C'TAN SHARD units) has this code, you can select both of that command protocol's directives instead of just one.
