    value: Select one enemy unit within 18" of and visible to this C'TAN SHARD (an enemy CHARACTER unit with a Wounds characteristic of 9 or less cannot be selected for this power while it is within 3" of another enemy unit, unless that CHARACTER unit is the closest visible enemy unit). Roll one D6; on a 2+ that unit suffers D3 mortal wounds (it suffers D6 mortal wounds instead if it has the VEHICLE keyword) and, until the start of your next turn, if that unit is a VEHICLE whose characteristics change as it loses wounds, then it halves the number of wounds it has remaining when determining what characteristics to use.
