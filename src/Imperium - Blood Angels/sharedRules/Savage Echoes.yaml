  If every unit from your army (excluding UNALIGNED untis) has the BLOOD ANGELS keyword, then every unit that has the Combat Doctrines ability and is in a BLOOD ANGELS Detachment gains the Savage Echoes ability, below.


  Whilst the Assault Doctrine is active, if a unit with this ability makes a charge move, is charged or performs a Heroic Intervention, add 1 to the Attacks characteristic of models in that unit until the end of the turn (note that this is cumulative with the bonus these models receive from the Shock Assault ability).
