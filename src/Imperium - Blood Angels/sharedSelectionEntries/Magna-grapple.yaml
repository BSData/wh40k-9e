        value: Each time an enemy VEHICLE unit (excluding AIRCRAFT) is selected to Fall Back whilst it is within Engagement Range of the bearer, you can engage the bearerâ€™s magna-grapple. If you do, roll 2D6. If the result is less than the Strength characteristic of that enemy unit, it can Fall Back normally; otherwise it cannot Fall Back this phase and must Remain Stationary instead.
