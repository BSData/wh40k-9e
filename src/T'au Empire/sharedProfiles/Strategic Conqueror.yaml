    value: In your Command phase, select one friendly SA'CEA unit within 9" of thie WARLORD. Until the start of your next Command phase, that unit gains the Objective Secured ability (see the Warhammer 40,000 Core Book). If that unit already has this ability, models in that unit count as one additional model when determining control of an objective marker.
