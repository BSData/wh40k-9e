    value: After both players have deployed their armies and determined who has the first turn, select up to one friendly <SEPT> unit, or up to three friendly <SEPT> units if you have selected the Kauyon Tactical Philosophy this battle (pg 92), and redeploy them. If the mission uses Strategic Reserves rules, any of these units can be placed into Strategic Reserves without having to spend any additional CPs, regardless of how many units are already in Strategic Reserves. If both players have abilities that redeploy units, roll off, the winner chooses who deploys their units first.
