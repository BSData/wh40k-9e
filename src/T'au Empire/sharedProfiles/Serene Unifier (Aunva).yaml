    value: "This unit's Aun'va model knows three invocations from the Invocations of the Ethereals (pg 76). In your Command phase, if this unit's Aun'va model is on the battlefield, it can intone up to two invocations it knows that have not already been intoned by a friendly model this turn. Roll one D6: on a 2+, the intoned invocation is inspiring and takes effect until the start of your next Command phase."
