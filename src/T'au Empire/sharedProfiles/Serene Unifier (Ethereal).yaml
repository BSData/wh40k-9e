    value: 'This model knows two invocations from the Invocations of the Ethereals (pg 76). In your Command phase, if this model is on the battlefield, it can intone one Invocation it knows that has not already been inspired by a friendly model this turn. Roll one D6: on a 3+, the intoned invocation is inspiring and takes affect until the start of your next Command phase.'
