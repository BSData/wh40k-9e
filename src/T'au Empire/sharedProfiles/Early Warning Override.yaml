      - Each time the bearer fires Overwatch, it scores hits on unmodified hit rolls of 5+, instead of 6.

      - Each time you use the Fire Overwatch Stratagem, if the bearer is on the battlefield and its unit is selected to fire Overwatch, reduce the CP cost of that Stratagem by 1CP (to a minimum of 0CP). Note that the CP cost is only reduced by 1CP for that use of the Stratagem, any future usages of it cost the normal amount of CPs.
