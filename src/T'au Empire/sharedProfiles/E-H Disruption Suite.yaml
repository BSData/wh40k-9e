      GHOSTKEEL BATTLESUIT model only. Once per battle, in your Command phase, the bearer can use this Prototype System. If it does, until the start of your next Command phase, it gains the following ability:


      E-H Disruption (Aura): While an enemy unit is within 12" of this model, each time your opponent selects that unit for a Stratagem and each time your opponent uses a Stratagem when that unit is selected to shoot or fight, increase the CP cost of that Stratagem by 1CP. Note that the CP used is only increased by 1CP for that use of the Stratagem, any future usages of it cost the normal amount of CPs.
