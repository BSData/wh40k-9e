  BATTLESUIT models in this unit can make attacks with ranged weapons even when their unit is within Engagement Range of enemy units, but they can only make such attacks against enemy units that they are within Engagement Range of. In such circumstances, these models can target an enemy unit even if other friendly units are within Engagement Range of the same enemy unit.


  Note that if a BATTLESUIT model has more than one ranged weapon, you can still choose to target units that are not within Engagement Range of its unit, but it will only be able to make the attacks with that weapon if all enemy units within Engagement Range of its unit have been destroyed when you come to resolve these attacks. In addition, when a BATTLESUIT model shoots a Heavy weapon, subtract 1 from the hit rolls when resolving that weapon's attacks while any enemy units are within Engagement Range of that model's unit.
