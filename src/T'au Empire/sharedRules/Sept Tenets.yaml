  If every unit from your army (excluding T'AU AUXILIARY, SUPREME COMMANDER and UNALIGNED units) is from the same sept, all T'AU EMPIRE units with this ability, and all models in them, gain a Sept Tenet. The Sept Tenet gained depends on which sept they are from, as shown on the following pages.


  If your sept does not have an associated Sept Tenet, you must instead create a new Sept Tenet for them, as described on pages 62-63. This allows you to customize the rules for your sept to best represent their fighting style.


  In either case, write down all of your Detachments' Sept Tenets on your army roster.
