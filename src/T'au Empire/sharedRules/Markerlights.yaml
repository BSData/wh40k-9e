  Units in your army can perform the following action:


  'Fire Markerlights (Action): One or more MARKERLIGHT units from your army can start to perform this action at the start of your Movement phase. AIRCRAFT MARKERLIGHT units can perform this action. The action is completed at the start of your next Shooting phase. If this action is successfully completed, for each model in that unit that is equipped with one or more markerlights, for each markerlight that model is equipped with, select one enemy unit within 36" of that model that would be an eligible target for that model if its unit had been selected to shoot, and roll one D6: on a 3+, that enemy unit gains one Markerlight token.'


  While a VEHICLE or DRONE unit is performing the Fire Markerlights action, that unit can move without the action failing. If it does, until the end of the turn, models in that unit without the VEHICLE or DRONE keyword that are equipped with any markerlights are treated as not having been equipped with markerlights for the purpose of the Fire Markerlights action.


  Each time a T'AU EMPIRE unit (excluding T'AU AUXILIARY units) is selected to shoot:


  - Each time a model in that unit makes a ranged attack against a unit with one or more Markerlight tokens, add 1 to that attack's hit roll.

  - After that unit has finished making attacks, for each enemy unit targeted by these attacks, remove one Markerlight token from that enemy unit.


  At the end of your Shooting phase, remove all Markerlight tokens from enemy units.
