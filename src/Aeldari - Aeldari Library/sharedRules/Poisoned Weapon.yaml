description: Many Drukhari weapons have the Poisoned Weapon ability. Such a weapon will have an ability that reads 'Poisoned Weapon' and then a value, such as (4+) or (2+). Each time an attack is made with a poisoned weapon against a unti (excluding VEHICLE or TITANIC units), an unmodified wound roll of this value is always successful.
