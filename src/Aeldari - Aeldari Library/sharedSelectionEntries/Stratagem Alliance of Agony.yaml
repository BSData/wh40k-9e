        value: Use this Stratagembefore the battle, when you are mustering your army, if your WARLORD is a REALSPACE RAIDER ARCHON. Select one SUCCUBUS model from your army and one HAEMONCULUS model from your army (excluding named characters) and determine one Warlord Trait for each of these models (this must be a Warlord Trait it can have); those models are only regarded as your WARLORD for the purposes of that Warlord Trait. Each Warlord Trait in your army must be unique (if randomly generated, re-roll duplicate results), and you cannot use this Stratagem to give a model two Warlord Traits. You can only use this Stratagem once.
