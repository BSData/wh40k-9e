        value: SOARING SPITE model only. While the wearer is embarked on a SOARING SPITE TRANSPORT, that vehicle may move an additional 6" in the movement phase. In addition, if a SOARING SPITE TRANSPORT is destroyed while the wearer is embarked upon it, you do not need to roll any dice to see if any disembarking models are slain or if the transport explodes - no disembarking models are slain and the transport does not explode.
