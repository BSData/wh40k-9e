          HARLEQUIN's model only.

          Each time an attack is made against the bearer, that attack's hit roll and wound roll cannot be re-rolled.

          Once per battle, in your Command phase, you can declare that the bearer will mimic Aelos. If you do so, until the start of your next Command phase, the bearer has a 3+ invulnerable save.
