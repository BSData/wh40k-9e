        value: Once per battle, when this model is destroyed, you can choose to roll one D6 at the end of the phase instead of using any rules that are triggered when this model is destroyed. If you do so, then on a 2+, set this model back up on the battlefield as close as possible to where they were destroyed but not within Engagement Range of any anamy models, with D3 wounds remaining.
