          In your Command phase, you can select one ALAITOC INFANTRY CORE unit within 9" of thie Warlord. Until the end of the turn, if that unit is performing an action, it can still make attacks with ranged weapons without that action failing.

          At the start of the first battle round, before the first turn begins, if this Warlord is on the battlefield, you can select one other friendly ALAITOC RANGERS unit on the battlefield. Remove that unit from the battlefield, and set it up anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9" away from the enemy deployment zone and any enemy models (if both players have abilities that redeploy units before the first turn begins, roll off; the winner chooses who redeploys their units first).
