        value: Once per turn, after rolling to determine the number of attacks made with a weapon by a friendly <HAEMONCULUS COVEN> CORE model whose unit is within 6" of this WARLORD, this WARLORD can use this ability. If it does so, you can re-roll the number of attacks made with that weapon and, until the end of the phase, each time you roll to determine the number of attacks made with a weapon by a model in that unit, you can re-roll the result.
