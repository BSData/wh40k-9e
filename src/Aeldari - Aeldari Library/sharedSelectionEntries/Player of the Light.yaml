          This Warlord is eligible to perform a Heroic Intervention if it is within 6" horizontally and 5" vertically of any enemy unit, instead of 3" horizontally and 5" vertically. Each time this Warlord makes a Heroic Intervention move, it can move up to 6". All other rules for Heroic Interventions still apply.

          Each time this Warlord fights, if it made a charge move or performed a Heroic Intervention this turn, then until that fight is resolved, add 1 to the Strength and Attacks characteristics of this Warlord.
