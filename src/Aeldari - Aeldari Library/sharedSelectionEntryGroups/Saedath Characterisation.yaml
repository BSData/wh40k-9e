              Each time an attack is made against a unit with this characterisation, if the attacking model is more than 18" away, an unmodified hit roll of 1-3 for that attack fails, irrespective of any abilities that the weapon or the model making that attack may have.

              Each time a unit with this characterisation makes a Normal Move or Advances in your Movement phase, in your following Shooting phase, that unit counts as having Remained Stationary. This does not apply if the unit is Embarked in a Transport.
