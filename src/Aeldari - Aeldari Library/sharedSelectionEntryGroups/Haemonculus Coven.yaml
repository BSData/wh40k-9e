If you do so, until the end of the phase, each time an attack is made with an enhanced weapon, add 1 to that attack's wound roll and add 1 to the Damage characteristic of that attack, but that attack's hit roll cannot be re-rolled. If any unmodified hit rolls of 1 are made for attacks with an enhanced weapon, the bearer's unit suffers 1 mortal wound after shooting with this weapon. If the bearer is a VEHICLE or MONSTER model, it suffers D3 mortal wounds instead.

              Each time a model with this Obsession makes an attack with a melee weapon (excluding Relics), improve the Armour Penetration characteristic of that attack by 1.

              If a unit with this Obsession is performing an action, it can still make attacks with ranged weapons without that action failing.

              At the start of your Command phase, each CHARACTER, GROTESQUES OR MONSTER unit with this Obsession regains 1 lost wound.

              Each time an attack is made against a unit with this Obsession, unless that attack has a Strength characteristic of 8 or more, an unmodified wound roll of 1-3 for that attack fails, irrespective of any abilities that the weapon or the model making the attack may have.

              Units with this Obsesion have the following abilities;

              Aura of Terror (Aura): While an enemy unit is within 6" of a unit with this Obsession, subtract 1 from the Leadership characteristic of models in that unit, and subtract 1 from Combat Attrition tests made for that unit.

              Each time you make a melee attack for a unit with this Obsession that targets a unit with a Leadership characteristic that is equal to or lower that the attacking unit's Leadership characteristic, add 1 to that attack's hit roll.
