              At the start of the Fight phase, if a unit with this Obsession is within Engagement Range of any enemy units, it can fight first that phase.

              Each time you declare a charge for a unit with this Obsession, if there are no other units from your army within Engagement Range of any of the enemy units selected as targets of that charge, add 1 to the charge roll.
