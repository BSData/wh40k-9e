              Units with this Obsession that have the Power From Pain ability (pg 89) treat the current battle round as being one higher than it actually is when determining what effects they gain.

              If a Realspace Raid Detachment includes a KABAL OF THE BLACK HEART ARCHON, then until the end of the battle, all BLADES FOR HIRE units in that Detachment that have the Power From Pain ability also treat the current battle round as being one higher than it actually is when determining what effects they gain.

              Add 1 to the Leadership characteristic of models with this Obsession

              Each time a unit with this Obsession is selected to shoot or fight, you can re-roll one hit roll when resolving that unit's attacks.
