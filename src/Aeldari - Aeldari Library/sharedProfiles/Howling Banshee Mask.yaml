    value: Each time you select an enemy unit as a target of a charge made by the bearer's unit, that enemy unit cannot fire Overwatch or Set to Defend against that charge. While an enemy unit is within Engagement Range of the bearer, if the bearer's unit made a charge move this turn, that enemy unit is not eligible to fight this phase until after all eligible units from your army have done so.
