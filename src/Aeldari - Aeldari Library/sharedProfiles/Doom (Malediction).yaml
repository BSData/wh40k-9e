    value: If manifested, select one enemy unit within 18" of this PSYKER. Until the start of your next Psychic phase, each time a <CRAFTWORLD> ASURYANI CORE or <CRAFTWORLD> ASURYANI CHARACTER unit from your army makes an attack that targets that enemy unit, you can re-roll the wound roll. If the result of the Psychic test was 10 or more, you can select one enemy unit within 24" of this PSYKER instead.
