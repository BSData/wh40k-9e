      If manifested, select one friendly <CRAFTWORLD> ASURYANI CORE or <CRAFTWORLD> ASURYANI CHARACTER unit within 18" of this PSYKER. Until the start of your next Psychic phase:

      That unit gains the Objective Secured ability.

      Each time a Morale test is taken for that unit, it is automatically passed.

      If that unit is performing an action, it can still make attacks with ranged weapons without that action failing.

      If the result of the Psychic test was 8 or more, you can select one friendly <CRAFTWORLD> ASURYANI CORE or <CRAFTWORLD> ASURYANI CHARACTER unit within 24" of this PSYKER instead.
