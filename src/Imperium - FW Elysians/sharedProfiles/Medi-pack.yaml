    value: At the end of any of your Movement phases, a model with a medi-pack can attempt to heal a single model.  Select a friendly ASTRA MILITARUM INFANTRY unit within 3" and roll a D6.  On a roll of a 4+, one model in the unit recovers a wound it lost earlier in the battle (if the model has a Wounds characteristic of 1, one model slain earlier in the battle is returned to the unit instead).  A unit can only be the target of this ability once in each turn.
