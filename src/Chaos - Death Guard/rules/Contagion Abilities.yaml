  Contagion abilities affect enemy models or units within Contagion Range - this changes with the battle round number, increasing as the battle progresses, as shown in the table below. The effects of multiple, identically named Contagion abilities is not cumulative (i.e. if an enemy unit is within range of two models with the same Contagion ability, that Contagion ability only applies to the enemy unit once). Note, that while similar in many regards to Aura abilities, Contagion abilities are not affected by abilities that affect Aura abilities, and vice versa.
