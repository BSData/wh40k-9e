      Instead of following the normal rules for Rapid Fire weapons, models in this unit firing Rapid Fire bolt weapons make double the number of attacks if any of the following apply:

      • The firing model’s target is within half the weapon’s maximum range.

      • The firing model is INFANTRY and every model in its unit remained stationary in your previous Movement phase.

      • The firing model is a TERMINATOR, BIKER or HELBRUTE.

      For the purposes of this ability, a Rapid Fire bolt weapon is any bolt weapon with the Rapid Fire type. A bolt weapon is any weapon whose profile includes the word ‘bolt’ (e.g. boltgun, bolt pistol, combibolter, Inferno boltgun). Rules that apply to bolt weapons also apply when firing the boltgun profile of combi-weapons and when firing Artefacts of Chaos that replaced a bolt weapon, (e.g. Spitespitter). The Talon of Horus is also a Rapid Fire bolt weapon.
