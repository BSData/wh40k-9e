        value: If manifested, select an enemy unit that is within 6" of the psyker and visible to him and roll a D6. If the result is greater than the enemy's Toughness, it suffers D3+3 mortal wounds. If a CHARACTER is slain by this power, you can add a Chaos Spawn to your army and set it up within 1" of the character before it is removed.
