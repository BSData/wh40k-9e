        value: "When you give a model this Relic, select one bolt weapon (See Codex: Space Marines) that model is equipped with. Each time the bearer shoots with that weapon, you can choose for it to fire a witchseeker bolt. If you do you can only make one attack with that weapon.\n\n• Each time you fire a Wtichseeker bolt, you can ignore the  Look Out Sir rule if the target is a PSYKER CHARACTER unit.\n• Each time an attack is made with a Witchseeker bolt against a PSYKER unit, a successful hit roll inflicts D3 mortal wounds on the target in addition to any normal damage.
