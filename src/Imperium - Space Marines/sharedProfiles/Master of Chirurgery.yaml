    value: At the end of any of your Movement phases, Harath Shen can attempt to heal or revive a single model. Select a friendly SALAMANDERS INFANTRY or BIKER unit within 3" of the Harath Shen. If that unit contains a wounded model, it immediately regains D3+1 lost wounds. If the chosen unit contains no wounded models but one or more of its models have been slain during the battle, roll a D6. On a 3+, a single slain model is returned to the unit with 1 wound remaining. If Harath Shen fails to revive a model, he can do nothing else for the remainder of the turn (shoot, charge, fight, etc.) as he recovers the gene-seed of the fallen warrior. A unit can only be the target of the Narthecium/Master of Chirurgery ability once in each turn.
