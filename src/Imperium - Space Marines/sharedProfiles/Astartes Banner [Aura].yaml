    value: "While a friendly <CHAPTER> CORE unit is within 6\" of this model, add 1 to the leadership characteristic of models in that unit. In addition, each time a model in such unit is destroyed by an attack made by an enemy model, roll one D6. On a 4+, do not remove the destroyed model from play - it can, after the attacking model's unit has finished making its attacks, either shoot with one of its ranged weapons as if it were your shooting phase or make one attack with one of its melee weapons as if it were the fight phase. After resolving these attacks, the destroyed model is then removed. "
