    value: This model is protected by specialised void shield generators, near-impenetrable barriers of force projected out at a distance from its hull in layers, designed to deflect and absorb the impact of high-energy attacks and missiles against them. In game terms, void shields are represented by a unique kind of saving throw shown in the Damage box, which the controlling player can opt to use instead of their normal save or invulnerable save against any form of attack except from weapons with the Melee type. Like invulnerable saves, void shield saves are unaffected by the AP of an attack, but unlike invulnerable saves they may also be used to negate mortal wounds. In this case however, roll one dice for each mortal wound that has been inflicted on the model, with the mortal wound being ignored if the save roll indicated in the Damage box is passed. Void shields must be continuously re-energised and renewed in combat operations and so as the unit is damaged, the defensive potential of its void shields is reduced (see the Damage table).
