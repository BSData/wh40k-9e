    value: 'The first time this model is destroyed, you can choose to roll one D6 at the end of the phase instead of using any rules that are triggered when a model is destroyed. If you do, then on a 4+, set this model back up on the battlefield as close as possible to where they were destroyed and more than 1" away  from any enemy models, with D3 wounds remaining. '
