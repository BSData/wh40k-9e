    value: When a Rapier Carrier is set up on the battlefield, its Space Marine Gunners are set up in unit coherency with it. From that point onwards the Space Marine Gunners are treated as one unit and the Rapier Carrier as another. The Space Marine Gunners may only be chosen as a target in the Shooting phase if they are the closest visible enemy unit to the firer.
