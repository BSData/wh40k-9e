    value: RED SCORPIONS units within 6" of any friendly RED SCORPIONS ANCIENTS add 1 to their Leadership. In addition, roll a D6 each time a RED SCORPIONS INFANTRY model is destroyed within 6" of any friendly RED SCORPIONS ANCIENTS, before removing the model as a casualty. On a 4+ that model musters one last surge of strength before succumbing to its wounds; it can either shoot with one of its weapons as if it were the Shooting phase, or make a single attack as if it were the Fight phase.
