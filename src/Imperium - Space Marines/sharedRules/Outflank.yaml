description: During deployment, if every model in this unit has this ability, then you can set up this unit behind enemy lines instead of setting it up on the battlefield. If you do, then in the Reinforcements step of one of your Movement phases you can set up this unit wholly within 6" of any battlefield edge and more than 9" away from any enemy models
