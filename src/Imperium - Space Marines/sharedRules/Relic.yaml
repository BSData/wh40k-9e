description: If your army is Battle-forged, no Detachment can contain more Relic units than it does non-Relic units of the same Battlefield Role. You can, however, include a single Relic Lord of War unit in your army even if it contains no non-Relic Lord of War units (you cannot include second and subsequent Relic Lord of War units unless they are taken in a Detachment that contains at least as many non-Relic Lord of War units). In addition, as long as a Battle-forged army included at least one RELIC unit, you gain access to the RELIC OF ANCIENT GLORY stratagem.
