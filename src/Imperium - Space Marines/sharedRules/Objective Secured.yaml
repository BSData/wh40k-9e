  If your army is battle-forged, all Troops units in ADEPTUS ASTARTES Detachments gain this ability.


  A player controls an objective marker if they have any models with this ability within range of that objective marker, even if there are more enemy models within range of that objective marker. If an enemy model within range of an objective marker also has this ability (or a similar ability), then the objective marker is controlled by the player who has the most models within range of that objective marker as normal.
