      Each time this unit fights, models in this unit can fight if:

      • They are within Engagement Range of any enemy units.

      • They are within 2½" of any enemy units.


      If, in the Fight phase, this unit is subject to any other rules that would reduce the number of models from this unit that are able to fight, then neither those rules nor the Swarming Masses rule take effect for that phase.
