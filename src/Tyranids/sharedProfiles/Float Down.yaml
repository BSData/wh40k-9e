    value: During deployment, you can set up this unit high in the skies instead of setting it up on the battlefield. If you do so, it can be set up in the Reinforcements step of your first, second or third Movement phase, regardless of any mission rules, and can be set up anywhere on the battlefield more than 9" away from any enemy models.
