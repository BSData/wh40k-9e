    value: During deployment, you can set up this model in hiding instead of setting it up on the battlefield. If you do so, then in the Reinforcements step of one of your Movement phases you can set up this model wholly within 6" of any battlefield edge or any terrain features and more than 9" away from any enemy models (or more then 6" away from enemy models if this model is set up wholly within your deployment zone), and, until the end of the turn, you can re-roll charge rolls made for this model.
