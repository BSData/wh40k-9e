              - Each time this PSYKER loses a wound, roll one D6: on a 5+, that wound is not lost.

              - If the result of the psychic test was 8 or more, while a friendly <DREAD HOUSEHOLD> WAR DOG-CLASS model is within 6" of this PSYKER, each time that model loses a wound, roll one D6: on a 6, that wound is not lost.

              - Subtract 1 from the Leadership characteristic of models in that unit.

              - Each time that unit is selected to shoot or fight, it must first take a Dread test. If that test is failed, then until the end of the current phase, reduce the Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill characteristics of models in that enemy unit by 1.

              - That unit cannot fire Overwatch or Set to Defend.

              - Keep a Spitesquall tally for that unit, adding one to the tally each time a model in that unit is destroyed. At the end of each phase, if that unit is still on the battlefield, roll one D6 for each mark on its Spitesquall tally: for each roll of 5+, that unit suffers 1 mortal wound. The unit's Spitesquall tally is reset to 0 at the end of each phase.
