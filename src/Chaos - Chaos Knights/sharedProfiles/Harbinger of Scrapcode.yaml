      In the Morale phase, select one enemy VEHICLE unit within 18" of this WARLORD. That unit must take a Dread test. If the test is failed:

      - That unit suffers 3 mortal wounds.

      - Until the start of the next Morale phase, models in that unit whose characteristics can change as they suffer damage are considered to have half the number of wounds remaining for the purposes of determining what those characteristics are (models in that units whose characteristics do not change as they suffer damage instead reduce their Ballistic Skill and Weapon Skill characteristics by 1).
