      - Once per turn, this WARLORD can attempt to Deny the Witch as if it were a PSYKER. If this WARLORD is a PSYKER, then in each enemy Psychic phase, it can instead attempt to Deny the Witch one additional time.

      - Each time this WARLORD loses a wound in the Psychic phase, roll one D6: on a 5+, that wound is not lost.
