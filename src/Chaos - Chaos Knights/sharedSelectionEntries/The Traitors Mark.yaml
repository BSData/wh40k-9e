        value: Once per battle, at the start of any battle round after the first, after you have selected a Harbinger ability to be active for your army, you can select one other Harbinger ability from that battle round, regardless of what Harbinger ability was selected in the previous battle round. The selected Harbinger ability is active for the bearer for the rest of the battle. This does not affect what Harbinger ability you can select in the next battle round.
