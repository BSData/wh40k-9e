      Once per battle, after rolling a D6 or a D3 when making an Advance roll, hit roll, wound roll, damage roll, charge roll or saving throw for this WARLORD, after any re-rolls (if any) have been made, you can change the result of one of those dice to be a 6 (or, in the case of a D3, a 3).


      While your army is Virtuous, this WARLORD can use the above rule once per turn, instead of once per battle.
