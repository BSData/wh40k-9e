      At the end of each of your Command phases, if your army is Honoured, you can select one Virtuous Chivalric ability from one of your selected Oaths. Until the end of your next Command phase, that Virtuous ability is active for this WARLORD. This may mean that different Chivalric abilities are active for this WARLORD than are active for other IMPERIAL KNIGHTS models in your army.
