    value: If this teaching is inspiring, while a <NOBLE HOUSEHOLD> ARMIGER-CLASS model is within 6" of this MENTOR, if that model is being affected by any Chivalric abilities, you count as having 2 more Honour points than you currently do when determining what those Chivalric abilities are. This may mean that different Chivalric abilities are active for different IMPERIAL KNIGHTS models from your army.
