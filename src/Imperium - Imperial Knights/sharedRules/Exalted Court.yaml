description: An upgraded model can only use its Noble Exemplar ability while your army is Honoured or Virtuous. If your army is Dishonoured, or if the upgraded model has no Bondsman abilities, its Noble Exemplar ability cannot be used. If the bearer has a Bondsman ability, it can use that Bondsman ability one additional time in each of your Command phases.
