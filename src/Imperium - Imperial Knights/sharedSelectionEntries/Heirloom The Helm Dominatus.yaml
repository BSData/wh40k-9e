        value: At the end of each of your Command phases, you can select one ARMIGER-CLASS model that is being effected by the bearer's Bondsman ability. While the bearer is on the battlefield, that ability will affect that ARMIGER-CLASS model until the end of the battle (instead of until the start of your next Command phase), or until that ARMIGER-CLASS model is affected by another Bondsman ability - whichever happens first.
