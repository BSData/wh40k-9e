                  When you give a model this gift, select one bolt weapon that model is equipped with. Before the battle, select one enemy Character unit. Once per battle, when the bearer shoots with that weapon you can choose for it to fire a Severance Bolt.


                  If you do, you can only make one attack with that weapon, but when selecting a target, you can ignore the Look Out, Sir rule so long as you select that Character unit as the target. When making an attack with a Severance Bolt against that Character unit, if it successfully hits the target:


                  - The target suffers D3 mortal wound and the attack sequence end

                  - If the target is a Psyker, roll 3D6; if the result exceeds the target's Leadership characteristic, randomly select one psychic power that is knows. That Psyker cannot use that psychihc power for the rest of the battle
