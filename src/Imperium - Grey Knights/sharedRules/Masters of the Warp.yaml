description: PSYKER units with this ability gain a bonus depending on which of the Tides of the Warp is dominant (see below). If you have a Battle-forged army, units only benefit from this bonus if every unit from your army has this ability (excluding Servitor units). At the start of the first battle rounds, choose which of the Tides if currently dominant. The dominant Tide can subsequently be changed using the Warp Shaping psychic power.
