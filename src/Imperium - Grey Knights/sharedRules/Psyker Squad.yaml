description: When manifesting or denying a psychic power, first select a model in the unit - measure range, visibility, etc. from this model. If the unit suffers Perils of the Warp, it suffers D3 mortal wounds as described in the core rules, but units within 6" with only suffer damage if the Perils of the Warp cause the last model in the manifesting unit to be slain.
