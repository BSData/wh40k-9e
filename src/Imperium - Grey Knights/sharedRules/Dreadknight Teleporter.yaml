description: If this model has a Dreadknight teleporter, then during deployment, you can set it up in a teleportarium chamber instead of placing it on the battlefield. At the end of any of your Movement phases this model can teleport into battle - set it up anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9" away from enemy models.
