description: Each time this unit makes a Normal Move, Advances, Falls Back, models in this unit can be moved across other models (and their bases) as if they were not there, and they can move within Engagement Range of enemy models. In addition, any verticle distance up and/or down that they make as part of that move is ignored. However, these models cannot finish this either on top of another model (or its base) or within Engagement Range of any enemy models
