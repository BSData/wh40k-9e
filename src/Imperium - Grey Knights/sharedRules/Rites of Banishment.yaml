description: When this unit manifests the Smite psychic power, it has a range of 12" rather than 18". Additionally, the target unit suffers only 1 mortal wound rather than D3 (whether or not the result of the Psychic test is more than 10) - unless the target is a Daemon in which case it suffers 3 mortal wounds instead of D3.
