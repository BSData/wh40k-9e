    value: In your Command phase, select one friendly AGRIPINAA CORE unit within 6" of this WARLORD. Until the start of your next Command phase, each time a model in that unit is destroyed by an attack made by an enemy model,  roll one D6; on a 4+, do not remove that destroyed model from play - it can, after the attacking model's unit has finished making its attacks, either shoot with one of its ranged weapons as if it were the Shooting phase, or make one attack with one of its melee weapons as if it were the Fight phase. After resolving these attacks, the destroyed model is then removed.
