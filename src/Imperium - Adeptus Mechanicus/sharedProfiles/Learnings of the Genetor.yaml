      At the start of your turn, you can select one of the aura abilities below. Until the start of your next turn, this Warlord is treated as having that aura ability on their datasheet.


      - Hyper-cybernetic Physiology: Roll one D6 each time a friendly <FORGE WORLD> KATAPHRON BREACHER, <FORGE WORLD> KATAPHRON DESTROYER or <FORGE WORLD > SERVITOR model would lose a wound whilst within 6" of this Warlord; on a  5+, that wound is not lost.


      - Biochemical Aggression: When resolving an attack made with a melee weapon by a friendly <FORGE WORLD> model whilst its unit is within 6" of this Warlord, on an unmodified wound roll of 6 improves the Armour Penetration characteristic of that weapon by 2 for that attack (e.g. AP0 becomes AP -2).


      - Excoriated Fear-Responses: When a Morale test is taken for friendly  <FORGE WORLD> unit within 6" of this Warlord, do not roll the dice; it is automatically passed.
