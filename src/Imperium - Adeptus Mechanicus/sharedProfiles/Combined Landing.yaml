      If a detachment contains multiple ARCHAEOPTER TRANSVECTOR models, you can choose for pairs of them to make combined landings instead of setting them up on the battlefield.

      For each combined landing that you want to make, select two <FORGE WORLD> ARCHAEOPTER TRANSVECTOR models:


      • Those two TRANSPORT models are treated as one model with a combined transport capacity of 12 <FORGE WORLD> INFANTRY models for the purposes of which units can be embarked within them. This means that an eligible INFANTRY unit containing 7-12 models can start the battle embarked within those two TRANSPORT models, the INFANTRY models in that unit being split between the two transports. Make a note of which INFANTRY models are embarked within which TRANSPORT model.


      • Those two TRANSPORT models can be set up in the Reinforcements step of your first, second or third Movement phase, regardless of any mission rules, and must be set up at the same time. Any units embarked within those TRANSPORT models must immediately disembark after the TRANSPORT models have been set up, and the disembarking units must be set up more than 9" away from enemy models.


      • When those two TRANSPORT models are set up, they must be set up within 9" of one another, and any disembarking units must follow the normal rules for disembarking transports and unit coherency
