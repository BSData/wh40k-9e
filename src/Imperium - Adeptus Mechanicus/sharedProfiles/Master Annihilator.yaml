    value: In your Command phase, select one friendly METALICA unit that is within 6" of this WARLORD. Until the start of your next Command phase, add 6" to the Range characteristic and 1 to the Strength characteristic of all radium weapons models in that unit are equipped with. For the purposes of this rule, a radium weapon is any weapon whose profile includes the word 'Radium' and any relic that replaces such a weapon. This is not cumulative with any other rule that increases the weapon's range.
