    value: In your Command phase, you can select one friendly MARS CULT MECHANICUS CORE unit within 6" of this WARLORD. If you do so, then select on Canticle - this can be one that has already been active for your army. Until the start of your next Command phase, both this WARLORD and that unit benefit from that selected Canticle instead of the one that is active for your army.
