        value: In your Command phase, you can select one friendly SKITARII VETERAN COHORT CORE unit within 9" of this model or you can select one friendly SKITARII VETERAN COHORT CORE DATA-TETHER unit anywhere on the battlefield, then select one Doctrina Imperative. Until the start of your next Command phase, that Doctrina Imperative is active for that unit, even if it has been active for your army already during this battle. Selecting a Doctrina Imperative with this rule does not prevent you from selecting it to be active for your army in subsequent battle rounds. If a unit has a rule that allows it to ignore the Deprecation effect of the currently active Doctrina Imperative, that rule only applies to one of the Doctrina Imperatives that are active for this unit (of your choice).
