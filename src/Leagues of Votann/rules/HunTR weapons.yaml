description: Many Votann ranged weapons have the type 'HunTR'. The number of attacks that a model makes with a HunTR weapon is equal to the number written on that weapon's profile after its type. For example, a model shooting a 'HunTR 1' weapon can make one attack with that weapon; a model firing a 'HunTR 3' weapon can make three attacks, and so on.
