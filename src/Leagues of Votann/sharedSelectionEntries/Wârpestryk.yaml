          - Each time the bearer makes a Normal Move, Advances, Falls Back, or makes a charge move, until that move is finished, it can move horizontally through models and terrain features (it cannot finish a move on top of another model, or its base).

          - Once per battle, when you use the Site-to-Site Teleport Stratagem, if you select the bearer's unit for that Stratagem, it costs 0 CP.

          - Enemy units that are set up on the battlefield as Reinforcements cannot be set up within 12" of this model's unit.
