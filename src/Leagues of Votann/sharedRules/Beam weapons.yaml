description: Some Votann weapons have the Beam abilty. Each time an attack is made with such a weapon, if a hit is scored, draw a line between the closest point of this model's base (or hull) and that of the closest model in the target unit. Make one wound roll against the target, and each other unit this line passes over (excluding units that were not eligible to be targeted by this weapon when targets were selected). When a VEHICLE model makes attacks with beam weapons that targets an enemy in Engagement Range, that attack is only resolved against the target unit and it cannot hit any other unit.
