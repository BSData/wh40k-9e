  Some Votann weapons have the Magna-rail ability. Each time an attack is made with such a weapon:

  - Invulnerable saves cannot be taken against that attack.

  - On an unmodified wound roll of 6, excess damage that weapon inflicts is not lost. Keep allocating excess damage to another model in the target unit until either all the excess damage has been allocated or the target unit is destroyed.
